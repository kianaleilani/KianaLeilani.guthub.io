Coding standards can help improve your skills as a software engineer and even help you learn programming languages. When coding, using coding standards and seeing it be applied as you are writing can help you improve your coding skills. You can use the coding standards to see what errors are in the code and how to fix them. This can help you learn new languages because it teaches you how to write the code in that language and points out errors. 
After using ESLint on Intellij, I have gotten a better appreciation for programming and programming in different languages. I have also been able to get a better understanding of what my functions do and how it applies to my overall program. Seeing the green check while using Intellij has been both helpful and painful. It is helpful because it tells me what I am doing wrong and sometimes gives suggestions on how to fix it. I also think it is painful because when there is an error and you donâ€™t know what is causing it, it can be very frustrating. However, as soon as you figure out why the error is happening then you can fix and appropriate the coding standards even more.
