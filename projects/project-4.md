Created a web application for HACC 2021's Hawai'i Marine Animal Response (HMAR), NIC Hawaii. This sighting and reporting app is to help streamline the process for the public to report monk seals, turtles, and seabirds, to be on a 24/7 web app instead of by call logs. The app helps HMAR resspond the animal sightings and animal's in distress.
